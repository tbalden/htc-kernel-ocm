TI LMU backlight device tree bindings

Required property:
  - compatible: Should be one of:
                "ti,lm3532-backlight"
                "ti,lm36272-backlight"
                "ti,lm36274-backlight"
                "ti,lm3631-backlight"
                "ti,lm3632-backlight"
                "ti,lm3633-backlight"
                "ti,lm3695-backlight"
                "ti,lm3697-backlight"

Optional properties:
  There are two backlight control mode. One is I2C, the other is PWM mode.
  Following properties are only specified in PWM mode.
  Please note that LMU backlight device can have only one PWM channel.

  - pwms: OF device-tree PWM specification.
  - pwm-names: a list of names for the PWM devices specified in the "pwms"
               property.

  For the PWM user nodes, please refer to [1].

Child nodes:
  LMU backlight is represented as sub-nodes of the TI LMU device [2].
  So, LMU backlight should have more than one backlight child node.
  Each node exactly matches with backlight control bank configuration.
  Maximum numbers of child nodes depend on the device.
  1 = LM36272, LM36274, LM3631, LM3632, LM3695
  2 = LM3633, LM3697
  3 = LM3532

  Required property of a child node:
  - led-sources: List of enabled channels from 0 to 4.
                 Please refer to LED binding [3].
                 For output channels, please refer to the datasheets [4].

  Optional properties of a child node:
  - label: Backlight channel identification.
           Please refer to LED binding [3].
  - default-brightness-level: Backlight initial brightness value.
                              Type is <u32>. It is set as soon as backlight
                              device is created.
                              0 ~ 2047 = LM36272, LM36274, LM3631, LM3632,
                                         LM3633, LM3695 and LM3697
                              0 ~ 255  = LM3532
  - ramp-up-msec, ramp-down-msec: Light dimming effect properties.
                                  Type is <u32>. Unit is millisecond.
                                  0 ~ 65 msec    = LM3532
                                  0 ~ 4000 msec  = LM3631
                                  0 ~ 16000 msec = LM3633 and LM3697
  - pwm-period: PWM period. Only valid in PWM brightness mode.
                Type is <u32>. If this property is missing, then control
                mode is set to I2C by default.

  - torch-brt: torch brightness when flash mode use
